To run this game, open MainGame.m in MATLAB. MATLAB may 
say that the program is not in the current path; simply 
click "Add to Path" to make this game runnable. Make sure 
all necessary files are in the same folder as MainGame.
This constitutes 8 .m files and 24 picture files.

When the game first starts, you will be asked to specify
some parameters in the console. After that, a countdown
will start, and then the game will launch.

The object of the game is to steer your character 
(the robot image) out of the way of the monster, 
using your arrow keys. Each time you successfully 
dodge the monster and the monster clears the screen, 
you will win a round. This game may still have a few 
bugs, but generally seems to run well. If the monster 
figure touches your robot figure, you will lose the 
round. If you run out of lives, you will lose the 
game (you get more lives each time you level up).

Custom settings have not been tested. Using the preset 
difficulty levels is most likely to result in reliable 
and quality gameplay, although the game can end very 
quickly at high difficulty levels.
